# dc-to-ac
This firmware is for ATTiny45 chip that causes two pins on the chip to alternate between high and low outputs. The reason for this is that I bought a cool desk LED tree light and it came setup such that you had to press the button a bunch
just to get it so the lights stayed on constantly. Then part way through the day it would shut off automatically. I really just wanted it to stay lit when plugged in and that is all. Turns out a kind of AC signal is required to get the lights
to light. So I created this code so I could replace the exisitng chip with an ATTiny45. It worked so I figured I would backup the insainly simple code here, because, why not.
